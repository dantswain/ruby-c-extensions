ruby-c-extensions
=================

Code and documentation surrounding my upcoming talk at [Fort Worth Ruby Brigade](http://www.rubyftw.org/). *gulp*

Link to the event on Plancast: http://plancast.com/p/gi6c

My intention is to use this repo to both share the code that I present and to stash my ideas as I develop the talk.
